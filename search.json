    "text": "Pairwise and higher-order network structure\n\nComplex systems, which model a collection of entities and their interactions, can be represented using several different mathematical objects. One common representation is a pairwise network where one assumes that only two entities may interact at once. Many empirical systems, however, often contain interactions between an arbitrary number of entities, also known as higher-order interactions. Higher-order networks, also known as hypergraphs, can model these higher-order interactions and can thus more accurately capture the structure, and potentially the dynamics, of these systems. We study the structure of these social systems and attempt to measure and model them in meaningful ways.\nReferences:\n\nThe simpliciality of higher-order networks\nFiltering higher-order datasets"

    "text": "Inferring network structure\n\nDetermining the structure of complex systems is inferential in nature; relationships between entities in that system are deduced from observational data such as paper co-authorship, proximity sensing, and contact tracing. For example, time-series data derived from contagion processes can uncover underlying connection patterns by determining which links best explain the system’s state transitions. We use Bayesian inference to reconstruct networks from all kinds of data: mobility, time-series, contact tracing, and survey data.\n\nReconstructing networks from simple and complex contagions"

    "text": "I come from Delhi, India—a city full of energy and diversity. I completed my Master’s in Biology, during which I developed a strong interest in studying the evolution of adaptations using theoretical and computational approaches.\nMy research so far has explored topics like sexual conflict, sexual convolution, cancer systems, and the evolution of sex-biased cooperation. Moving forward, I’m excited to expand my work during my PhD, combining both wet and dry lab methods to tackle questions in evolution and ecology. One area I’m particularly curious about is the evolution of contagion spread—whether in pathogens or ideas—exploring how opinions or diseases propagate within communities and eventually develop strategies to combat this spread (for the diseases). Outside the lab, you’ll find me deep into either video or board games, hunting for the best coffee and beer spots, or exploring cities and nature. I’m always up for a chat about evolutionary theories over a cold brew or a round of Avalon!\nI’m looking forward to joining the lab, learning from everyone, and contributing to meaningful research!"
