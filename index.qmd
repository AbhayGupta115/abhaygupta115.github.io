I'm a PhD student at the University of Virginia, working with Dr. Nicholas Landry on how contagions spread and evolve within communities — with the long-term goal of developing strategies to combat that spread.

I grew up in India and completed my Master's in Biology there, where I fell into theoretical and computational approaches while studying how organisms adapt — from sexual conflict to cancer dynamics. The thread connecting it all is evolution, just at different scales.

Outside the lab, you'll find me deep into video or board games, hunting for the best coffee and beer spots, or exploring cities and nature. Always up for a chat about evolutionary theory over a cold brew.
